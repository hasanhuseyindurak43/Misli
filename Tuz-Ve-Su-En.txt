Salt and water

An Indian old master was tired of his apprentice constantly complaining about everything.One day he sent his apprentice to get salt.When the apprentice, who was unhappy with everything in his life, returned, the old master told him to throw a handful of salt in a glass of water and drink.The apprentice did what the old man said, but he began to spit on his mouth as soon as he drinks."How does it taste?"he answered the old man in anger, "bitter," he answered.The master giggled his apprentice and grabbed his apprentice and took it out.He quietly took him to the shore of the lake, and this time he threw a handful of salt into the lake and told him to drink water from the lake.The apprentice, who made what is said, asked the same question while wiping the water flowing from the edges of the mouth: "How does it taste?""Refresctor," the young apprentice replied."Did you enjoy the salt?""No," he answered the old man.Then the old man sat next to his apprentice kneeling next to the water and said: "The pain in life is like salt, neither less nor too. The amount of pain is always the same. However, the pain of pain depends on what is put into it.The thing is to expand your feelings about what is painful.
